JAVA HISTORY AND BASIC CONCEPTS:
*java is an object-oriented,class-based,concurrent,secured and general-purpose computer programing language.(java is high level language)
*java is an interpreted language.
*java was developed by Sun microsystems (which is now the subsidiary(it means anubandha or a company that belongs to another company which is usually referred to as the parent company) of oracle)in the year 1995.
*James Gosling is known as the father of java.
*firstly it was called "GREENTALK",then its name was Oak.since oak was already registered company,so james gosling and  his team changed the name from oak to java.
*according to sun microsystems ,3 billion devices run java like	! desktop applications such as acrobat reader,media player etc....,!web applications like javatpoint.com etc...!enterprise applications such as banking applications!mobile !embedded system(eg.mp3 players,video game consoles etc...),!smart card !robotics !games  etc.....
*java applications:there are mainly  4 types of applications that can be created using java programing.
                                 1.STANDALONE APPLICATION:this is also known as  desktop applications or window-based applications.examples of these applications are media player,antivirus etc..
                                  AWT and Swing are used in java for creating standalone applications.
                                2.WEB APPLICATION:an application that runs on the server side and  creates a dynamic page is called web application.
                                3.ENTERPRISE APPLICATION:eg.banking applications etc.. .it has advantages like high-level security,load balancing and clustering(it means  a number of similar things growing or grouped closely together).
                                    in java EJB is used for creating enterprising applications.
                                 4.MOBILE APPLICATION:which is created for mobile devices.
                                    currently,android and java ME(micro edition) are used for creating mobile applications.
*the features of java  are also known as java buzzwords.
* the most important features of java are object oriented,simple,secured,platform independent,robust(strong),portable,architecture neutral,dynamic,interpreted,high performance,multithreaded,distributed.
 *there are two types of platforms  software-based and hardware-based.java provides a software-based platform.in the sense that it is a software-based platform that runs on the top of other hardware-based platforms.
                     ->top of hardware based it has two components:1)runtime environment  2)API(application programming interface)
*this java code we can run any platform that is WORA(write once and run anywhere)
*java is secured because:
                                     ->no explict pointer,java programs runs inside a virtual machine sandbox,classloader,bytecode verifier,security manager.
                        java language provides these securities by default.
*class keyword is used to declare a class in java.
*public keyword is an access modifier that represents visibility.it means it is visible to all.
*void is the return type of the method.it means it doesnot return any value.
*main represents the starting point of the program.
*static is a keyword,if we declare any method as static it is known as the static method.the core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create an object.
*String[] args or String args[] is used for command line argument.
*System.out.println() is used to print statement
* PACKAGE:-->package is a container which can segregate the files in java project.




OOPS CONCEPTS->collection of objects and classes.
      1)object-->An entity that exists physically in the real world which requires some memory will be called as an object.
                 Every object will contain some "properties" and some "actions".
                 The properties are the data or information which describes the object and they are represented by variables.
                 Actions are the tasks or the operations performed by the object they are represented by methods.
      2)class -> A class is a  collection of  common Properties and common actions of a group of objects.
                 A class can be considered  as a plan or a model or a blueprint for creating an object.
                 For a class we can create any number of objects.
                 without class we cannot create objects.
                 An object is an instance of a class.
ENCAPSULATION:
     Encapsulation is a process of binding the variables and methods into a single entity.
     Using this we can implement abstraction(data hiding).
     Using this we can improve the maintenance of the application.

INHERITANCE:
       Inheritance is a process of acquiring the members from one class to another class.
       Using this we can achieve reusability and there by reduce  the code size and reduce the development time.

POLYMORPHISM:
       If a single entity shows  multiple behaviours then it is called as polymorphism.
       we do Method overloading and method overriding.
